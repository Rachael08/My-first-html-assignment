        <h1><b>MY MOTIVATION TO BEING A WEB DEVELOPER</b></h1>
        <h4>
            I have always wanted to know one or two things in the IT world.
            Getting to be part of the CapacityBay Family is a privilege I do not take for granted.
            During the course of this program, I have experienced to an extent how challenging, functional and
            creative web development can be.
            Getting to know this about web development has fueled my interest in building tech skills.
            Web development is artistic and beautiful. It has given me a chance to express my creativity in the technical world.
            Web development is poised for continued growth and innovation. <br> <br> I look forward to when I'll be a professional web developer and also 
            learn more functional skill that will make me relevant in the IT world. 
            Five years from now, I'll love to be among programmers that creates websites and mobile apps, develop complex software systems
            whether in business, healthcare, education, or any other field. I will love to experience in full the many growth opportunities programming has 
            to offer. I look forward to collaborating with people from all sorts of backgrounds and cultures, broaden my horizons and enhance my creativity, 
            learn about new technologies and techniques.
